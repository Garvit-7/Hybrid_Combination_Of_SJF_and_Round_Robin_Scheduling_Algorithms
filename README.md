# Hybrid_Combination_Of_SJF_and_Round_Robin_Scheduling_Algorithms

The hybrid scheduling algorithm combines the Round Robin (RR) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling techniques to optimize process scheduling in operating systems. This algorithm aims to strike a balance between fairness and efficiency by considering the burst time of processes.
